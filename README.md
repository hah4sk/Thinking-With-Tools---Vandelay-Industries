# Thinking-With-Tools---Vandelay-Industries
Repo for code related to Technical Interview with Thinking With Tools LLC

## Purpose
This code is meant to serve as a tool for the fictitious company, Vandelay Industries, as a means to make better financial decisions regarding stakeholder's choices in car purchases/sellings.  By processing through a rudimentary API, Vandelay wants help making better business decisions, and seeks to do so with a streamlined form of datasearching.  

## How The Code Works
The following functions can be broken up into three main categories:

### QUERY FUNCTIONS  
'query()' is used to search the website directory, and pulls data from online to return a List<String>, with each
element containing an entry from the site that fits the specifications.  

### FILTERING FUNCTIONS
The filtering functions take the output of 'query()' and allows the user to further narrow down the search space
 
### HELPER/MISC FUNCTIONS
The rest of the functions are those with limited functionality, but may be useful in a small
set of cases, or may be useful for further development in the future
